# scraping-test

Full stack demo web app showing my hometown historical weather data:  
  - back-end: node.js server with cheerio.js for scraping,  
  - front-end: React and Material-UI client with D3.js for data visualization.

Clone and run **npm i** in main folder (for installing server dependencies) and client folder (for installing client dependencies)

Use **npm run dev** in main folder to start server and client simultaneously on local computer
